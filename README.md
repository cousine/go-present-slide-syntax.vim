## Original Author

I'm not the original author of this syntax file; I've copied the syntax off a
gist some time ago for personal use without taking note of the owner.

Right now I'm cleaning up my home dir so I thought I'd extract this into a plugin
in an effort to keep things decoupled.

If you are the original author of this syntax file, please email me so I can 
properly attribute you here.
